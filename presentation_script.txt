Title: Enhanced Tic-tac-toe: A Web-based Implementation with Time Constraints
Good morning/afternoon everyone,
Today, I'd like to present our enhanced version of the classic Tic-tac-toe game, which we've implemented as a web application with some unique twists and challenges.
Project Overview
Our goal was to create a web-based Tic-tac-toe game that maintains the traditional 3x3 grid structure but introduces additional gameplay mechanics to make it more challenging and engaging. We implemented this using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it accessible to anyone with a web browser.
Key Features
Traditional Gameplay Elements
3x3 game board
Two players: X and O
Classic winning conditions (3 in a row, column, or diagonal)
Unique Game Mechanics
10-second time limit per move after a player's second move
Automatic removal of oldest move when time expires
Move tracking system for each player
Real-time timer display
Technical Implementation
We structured our solution using:
HTML for the game board structure
CSS Grid for layout and styling
JavaScript for game logic and interactivity
Challenges Faced and Solutions
Move Management Challenge
Initially struggled with tracking moves for each player
Solved by implementing a 'moves' object that maintains separate arrays for X and O
   let moves = {'X': [], 'O': []};
Timer Implementation
Challenge: Needed to track time accurately without affecting gameplay
Solution: Implemented a non-blocking timer using setInterval
Added visual feedback showing remaining time
Move Removal Logic
Major challenge: Removing oldest move while maintaining game state
Initially faced issues where new moves wouldn't appear after old move removal
Solved by restructuring the move handling sequence:
1. Add new move first
Check and remove old move if necessary
Update move history
User Interface Considerations
Needed clear visual feedback for:
Current player's turn
Time remaining
Game status (win/draw)
Solved through real-time DOM updates and clear status messages
Code Structure Improvements
We organized our code into distinct functions:
createBoard() for initial setup
handleMove() for move processing
checkWinner() for win conditions
disableBoard() for game end handling
Testing and Refinement
We encountered and fixed several edge cases:
Multiple moves within time limit
Timing issues with move removal
Win condition checking after move removal
Browser compatibility issues
Future Enhancements
Potential improvements we've identified:
Adding an AI opponent
Implementing a scoring system
Adding game history
Creating different difficulty levels
Adding multiplayer support
Learning Outcomes
This project helped us understand:
Complex state management in JavaScript
Real-time event handling
DOM manipulation
Time-based game mechanics
User experience considerations
Conclusion
This enhanced version of Tic-tac-toe demonstrates how classic games can be reimagined with modern web technologies. The addition of time constraints and move management creates a new layer of strategy while maintaining the game's fundamental appeal.
Thank you for your attention. Are there any questions?
